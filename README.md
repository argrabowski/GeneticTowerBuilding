# Genetic Tower Builder

## Instructions

Our project contains the runnable python file `ga.py`. The program takes in three command-line arguments as specified
by the assignment: puzzle number selected, filename for the puzzle information, and how many seconds the program will
run. For example, to run the tower building genetic algorithm with the test file for 10 seconds, navigate to this
repository's src folder and execute the following command: `ga.py 2 ../TowerBuilding.txt 10`

**_DISCLAIMER_**: The `numpy` package must be installed in order to run `NumberAllocation.py`.
